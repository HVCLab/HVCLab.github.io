  bio: >
    Yulia is a cognitive neuroscientist with interests in everything 
    related to speech and language.
    Prior to starting the lab in Tübingen, she worked as a postdoc at  
    the University of California, San Francisco and got her PhD at the 
    Freie Universitat and the Bernstein Center for Computational 
    Neuroscience (BCCN) in Berlin.
    Outside science Yulia studies trilingual language acquisition with 
    her son and waits for him to walk well enough to explore the hiking 
    trails around Tuebingen.
    Yulia speaks Russian, German, Hebrew, and English in her day to day. 
    She sometimes tries to speak Spanish and French, but mostly with little success.

    Charlotte is a speech and language therapist turned cognitive scientist with
    an interest in the neural underpinnings of multimodal language processing. 
    After receiving her B.A. from the Ludwig-Maximilians University in Munich, 
    Charlotte moved to Kaiserslautern and completed her M.Sc. in Cognitive Science 
    at the Technical University. In February 2022, she joined the HVC lab as a 
    PhD student. Charlotte is currently interested in temporal landmarks in the 
    speech signal and plans on using electrophysiological as well as behavioral 
    data in the future.
    In her free time, she enjoys making lino prints and trying out new recipes. 
    Charlotte speaks German and English, and is currently brushing up on her French.

    Mara is a natural scientist with a focus on auditory neuroscience and electrophysiological 
    signal processing. She started as a PhD candidate in the lab in February 2022. Mara completed 
    her Bachelors in biological sciences at Goethe University Frankfurt, where she did research 
    on the auditory system of bats. For her Masters, she specialized in interdisciplinary 
    neuroscience at the same university. Her main interest lies in how the human auditory 
    system integrates information over time, in particular how humans adjust to different 
    speech rates. Outside of the lab, she enjoys jogging and singing/songwriting with her guitar. 
    Mara speaks German, Luxembourgish, English and French, she also tries to wrap her head around 
    Greek (amazing how every Greek sentence feels like a math formula!).

    Andrey received a B.A. degree in Linguistics and an M.A. degree in Cognitive Neuroscience at 
    the HSE University, Moscow, Russia. He has been using neuroimaging and stimulation methods in 
    clinical populations to study the neuroanatomical substrates of language processing. In 2022, 
    Andrey joined the HVC lab as a student of the 5-year M.Sc./Ph.D. program at the International 
    Max Planck Research School: The Mechanisms of Mental Function and Dysfunction. His research aims 
    to better understand the mechanisms that enable the mapping between the phonological and the 
    lexical-semantic representations of words. In his free time, Andrey likes doing sports, with his 
    favorite one being skiing. He speaks Russian and English.

  is_current: True
  position: PhD Student
  bio: >
    Luzie is a Biologist, who focused on Neurobiology in her Masters. In April 2024 she started as a PhD 
    candidate in the lab. In her Bachelors Luzie studied Biology at the University of Tübingen and 
    as she realized that the brain and all its mysteries fascinated her the most regarding the big topic of Biology, 
    she decided to continue with the Neurobiology Master in Tübingen. After she completed her Masters, 
    she did an ERASMUS+ internship at the University of Gent, where she worked on an EEG project about conformity. 
    In the lab, she is now investigating the different states of neutrality in the brain during a perceptual decision-making task. 
    Outside of the lab Luzie enjoys doing sports and yoga and reading all kind of books. 
    Luzie speaks German and English, and knows some basics in French and Kiswahili.

  bio: >
    Lea-Marie is studying medicine at the University of Tübingen with a special interest in neurology and psychosomatics. 
    Her curiosity for bilingual language processing and the background of language-associated diseases motivated her to
    join the hvc lab as a medical student in October 2022. Her research aims to better understand cross-linguistic effects on 
    neural language processing, especially with regard to syllable rhythm. Beyond her research, Lea-Marie is also passionate about 
    foreign languages paving the way to explore and learn about different cultures. In her free time, Lea-Marie enjoys exploring new 
    jogging tracks across Tübingen and playing the flute in different orchestras. In addition to her native German, she speaks English, 
    French, some Italian and is always happy to find new conversation partners to improve her knowledge of Thai.

    Leon recently decided to say good bye to teaching and the Bachelor of Education. He joined the lab for his bachelor 
    thesis on sound complexity and perceptual onsets for a smooth transitioning into the MSc in either neurobiology or 
    cognitive science. Majoring in Biology and English situate him at the intersection between science and humanities which 
    fostered strong cross-disciplinary critical thinking and a solid foundation for working in very interdisciplinary fields. 
    He also helps out at the Neuroscience Student Lab taking care of the sheep brain but he cannot wait to get his hands on 
    living material.

    Victoria is a student of Computational Linguistics at the University of Tübingen. Her interest in languages started at a 
    young age as she grew up bilingual and continued learning languages as a hobby. While her studies deepened her interest in 
    speech processing and natural language understanding, Victoria's passion for understanding the human brain led her to join 
    the hvc lab as a research assistant. Here, she applies her knowledge in computational linguistics to explore the connections 
    between language and cognition. Outside of her academic commitments she loves to bake and play the guitar or piano.
