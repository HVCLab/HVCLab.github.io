## Lab Hike! 

Mid October, the HVC Lab took a break and went on a hike in the forests around Bad Urach. <br>
Bad Urach is a beautiful little town in the Swabian Alb known for its' waterfalls, hot springs, little canyons and wooded hills. 
From T체bingen, it can be reached by train in about 45 minutes.<br><br>

We chose a golden autumn day for our hike, enjoyed the views from the top of the hill and caught some extra sun before the winter. <br><br>
Back in T체bingen, we completed our trip with Swabian K채sesp채tzle and other local dishes, which is just the right food after a long hike.
It was refreshing to spend time together, away from our office desks, outside in nature!
