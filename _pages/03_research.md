Verbal communication, in particular speech comprehension, relies on a combination of general auditory and speech-specific mechanisms, as well as on their interactions with multimodal and wide-spread neural networks that support other cognitive functions (e.g., attention and decision making). We study the cognitive and neural mechanisms that support language comprehension and verbal communication, in monolingual and bilingual individuals.

# Methodologies
We use multiple electrophysiological methodologies, including whole-brain recordings using MEG and EEG, as well as intracranial electrophysiology in clinical settings (iEEG). This combination provides us with the unique opportunity to study human communication across neuronal scales: whole-brain neural dynamics in MEG, and submillimeter spatial resolution of intracranial recordings. Experimentally, we combine the analysis of continuous naturalistic stimuli with targeted hypothesis-driven task and stimulus designs.

# Previous Research Projects

### Cortical representations of syllables in continuous speech
The continuous speech signal is characterized by prominent temporal modulations of its overall amplitude, reflective of its syllabic structure. In my postdoctoral work at UCSF, I probed how the speech envelope is encoded in the speech cortex using intracranial recordings from neurosurgical patients. We discovered that neuronal populations in speech cortex represent the speech amplitude envelope through encoding of rapid increases in the envelope (acoustic edges). This representation reflects the rate of amplitude change, cueing the timing and stress of syllables (Oganian & Chang, Sci Adv, 2019).
